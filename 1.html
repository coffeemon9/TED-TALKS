<img src="concrete.jpg" width="80%">
<p>Imagine <strong>walking <u>five kilometers</u></strong> to school every day, under the scorching sun, no trees, no shed in sight, writing final exams outside in the dry, sweltering heat, and still being expected to pass with flying colors. And then after school, or sometimes before, or sometimes both, trekking four hours to the nearest water source, standing in long queues just to get a few drops from a drying well.<br> This is the daily life of <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/nkosilathi_nyathi_a_next_generation_solution_to_climate_crisis" target="_blank" title="ted talks-climate change">myself</a> and over thousands of schoolchildren in my city alone. And the life of millions of children all across Africa and around the globe.</p>
